# buggy_pyheap

This is a simple python heap implementation that is buggy.

## Inspiration

This was written to help a friend who was learning how debug python code that contains tests.

## Branch

This is the `working` branch. The heap implementation here should work correctly with all the tests passing.

## License

This code is released under the MIT license. See the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for more information.

## Installation

The only requirement is `pytest`.

If you do not have a python environment set up, you can use the codespace for a fully set up environment.
