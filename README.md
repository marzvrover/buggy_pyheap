# buggy_pyheap

This is a simple python heap implementation that is buggy.

## Inspiration

This was written to help a friend who was learning how debug python code that contains tests.

## Branch

This is the `working` branch. The heap implementation here should work correctly with all the tests passing.

You can compare other branches to this branch to see the changes that were made to introduce the bugs.
